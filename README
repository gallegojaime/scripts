### scripts
#
#   A collection of hacked together scripts I use for common daily tasks.
#   These are NOT production-worthy and are only uploaded here for informational
### and (anti-)educational purposes. 
  # DISCLAIMER: if I find out you are using these scripts on production environments,
  # I will personally find you, slap you, and revoke your programmer's license.

Listing:

- aliases: common aliases to make some scripts operable, like switchwork.
- backlight: brightness control for montesquieu laptop, through nvidia's dev file.
- def: use StarDict to look up definitions in Longman, 1913 Webster, and other
	installed dictionaries such as the Jargon File.
- goog: an attempt of making Google searches more directly with Links. Takes
	arguments and uses them as the search query string.
- jordi: nohup with stdout and stderr redirection to /dev/null. Takes one
	argument, the program's path. Useful for keeping programs alive after
	terminal is closed. 
- lisp: call the lisp interpreter. "clisp" is ugly.
- switchwork: I have two main directory trees in my computer. This command switches between the two.
