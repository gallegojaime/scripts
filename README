### scripts
#
#   A collection of hacked together scripts I use for common daily tasks.
#   These are NOT production-worthy and are only uploaded here for informational
### and (anti-)educational purposes. 
  # DISCLAIMER: if I find out you are using these scripts on production environments,
  # I will personally find you, slap you, and revoke your programmer's license.

Listing:

- backlight: brightness control for montesquieu laptop, ACPI control is broken.
- conneth: use dhcpcd to connect to the Internet via my desktop's Ethernet.
- def: use StarDict to look up definitions in Longman, 1913 Webster, and other
	installed dictionaries (personally I love the Jargon File)
- goog: an attempt of making Google searches more directly with Links. Takes
	arguments and uses them as the search query string.
- jordi: nohup with stdout and stderr redirection to /dev/null. Takes one
	argument, the program's path. Useful for keeping programs alive after
	terminal is closed. 
- lisp: call the lisp interpreter because "clisp" is, ugh, such an ugly command.
