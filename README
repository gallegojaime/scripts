### scripts
#
#   A collection of hacked together scripts I use for common daily tasks.
#   These are NOT production-worthy and are only uploaded here for informational
### and (anti-)educational purposes. 
  # DISCLAIMER: if I find out you are using these scripts on production environments,
  # I will personally find you, slap you, and revoke your programmer's license.

Listing:

- jordi: nohup with stdout redirection to /dev/null. Takes one argument, the
	program's path. Useful for keeping programs alive after terminal is closed
	while silencing it as it's still open (aka, the program is jordihurtado'd).
- conneth: use dhcpcd to connect to the Internet via my desktop's Ethernet.
- goog: an attempt of making Google searches more directly with Links. Takes
	arguments and uses them as the search query string.
- scrls: lists files on the script directory.
- scrmod: opens a script file, path relative to the script directory, in an
	interactive editor. Takes name of script.
- execperms: gives exec permissions to files on the script directory. 
- procras: shows days left to several deadlines.
